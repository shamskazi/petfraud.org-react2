Pet Protection
About PetFraud.org
PetFraud.org is a heartfelt community united by love for animals and the determination to protect them from harm. The story of PetFraud.org began in 1998, when our founder embarked on a life-changing journey of rescuing, rehoming, and adopting animals in need.

Over the years, we've seen the best and worst of humanity—countless acts of kindness that restore faith, but also heartbreaking examples of exploitation. Innocent animals are often used as emotional bait, their suffering crafted into tragic tales designed to manipulate well-meaning individuals. Fraudsters masquerade as volunteers, a term that evokes trust and authority but is sadly unregulated. Unlike reputable shelter workers, these imposters use their guise to prey on compassion. Some unethical breeders go so far as to rebrand discarded animals as "adoptions," charging exorbitant fees while falsely claiming credit for noble deeds. And these are just a few examples; the realm of pet-related scams extends even further, including into pet sales—a practice we neither promote nor condone but acknowledge as rife with deceit. These issues demand urgent attention, and that's why we exist.

PetFraud.org was founded with the mission to stop pet-related fraud activities and to say "enough is enough." As a global coalition, we are committed to exposing these injustices, creating a safe space for animal lovers to connect and take a stand. Together, we protect animals and the people who care for them, tackling these troubling gray areas with collective strength, empathy, and unwavering resolve.

Cats on a Mission
Our Mission
PetFraud.org exists to create a world where compassion prevails, and trust is not exploited. We are here to empower individuals and communities with the tools, knowledge, and resources to:

Identify Scams: Equip the public with the ability to recognize deceitful practices involving animals.
Report Exploitation: Provide victims with accessible platforms to share their experiences and seek help.
Stop Malicious Activities: Collaborate with experts to expose unethical behavior, raise awareness, and create preventative measures.
Support Victims: Offer guidance and emotional support to those affected, ensuring they feel empowered and not alone.
These harmful practices not only endanger animals but also extinguish the kindness and trust that inspire people to help in the first place. Many victims of pet scams feel isolated, fearful, or even ashamed, leaving them to suffer in silence. This silence impacts both the people and animals involved, perpetuating a cycle of harm and mistrust. PetFraud.org is here to break that silence. We are a sanctuary for those in need, a collective force of individuals who believe in protecting what matters most: kindness, compassion, and the lives of animals.

Knowing fraudsters are constantly devising new schemes, our strategy is to foster awareness and encourage people to act confidently and purposefully. By doing so, we aim to preserve the humanity and love that drive positive change. Together, we can ensure that good intentions lead to good outcomes and that no one has to face these challenges alone.

Join us in this vital mission. With your support, we can create a brighter future for animals and the people who love them.
